BrowserType provides methods to launch a specific browser instance or connect to an existing one. The following is a typical example of using Playwright to drive automation:

**sync**

```py
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright, Playwright

def run(playwright: Playwright):
    chromium = playwright.chromium
    browser = chromium.launch()
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("https://example.com")
    # other actions...
    browser.close()

with sync_playwright() as playwright:
    run(playwright)
```

**async**

```py
import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright, Playwright

async def run(playwright: Playwright):
    chromium = playwright.chromium
    browser = await chromium.launch()
    page = await browser.new_page()
    await page.goto("https://example.com")
    # other actions...
    await browser.close()

async def main():
    async with async_playwright() as playwright:
        await run(playwright)
asyncio.run(main())
```


---

## Methods

### connect {/* #browser-type-connect */}



This method attaches Playwright to an existing browser instance created via `BrowserType.launchServer` in Node.js.

:::note

The major and minor version of the Playwright instance that connects needs to match the version of Playwright that launches the browser (1.2.3 → is compatible with 1.2.x).
:::

**Usage**

```python
browser_type.connect(endpoint)
browser_type.connect(endpoint, **kwargs)
```

**Arguments**
- `endpoint` str 
  
  A Playwright browser websocket endpoint to connect to. You obtain this endpoint via `BrowserServer.wsEndpoint`.
- `expose_network` str *(optional)* 
  
  This option exposes network available on the connecting client to the browser being connected to. Consists of a list of rules separated by comma.
  
  Available rules:
  1. Hostname pattern, for example: `example.com`, `*.org:99`, `x.*.y.com`, `*foo.org`.
  1. IP literal, for example: `127.0.0.1`, `0.0.0.0:99`, `::1`, `0:0::1:99`.
  1. `<loopback>` that matches local loopback interfaces: `localhost`, `*.localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`.
  
  Some common examples:
  1. `"*"` to expose all network.
  1. `"<loopback>"` to expose localhost network.
  1. `"*.test.internal-domain,*.staging.internal-domain,<loopback>"` to expose test/staging deployments and localhost.
- `headers` Dict\[str, str\] *(optional)* 
  
  Additional HTTP headers to be sent with web socket connect request. Optional.
- `slow_mo` float *(optional)* 
  
  Slows down Playwright operations by the specified amount of milliseconds. Useful so that you can see what is going on. Defaults to 0.
- `timeout` float *(optional)* 
  
  Maximum time in milliseconds to wait for the connection to be established. Defaults to `0` (no timeout).

**Returns**
- Browser

### connect_over_cdp {/* #browser-type-connect-over-cdp */}



This method attaches Playwright to an existing browser instance using the Chrome DevTools Protocol.

The default browser context is accessible via [browser.contexts](/api/class-browser.mdx#browser-contexts).

:::note

Connecting over the Chrome DevTools Protocol is only supported for Chromium-based browsers.
:::

:::note
This connection is significantly lower fidelity than the Playwright protocol connection via [browser_type.connect()](/api/class-browsertype.mdx#browser-type-connect). If you are experiencing issues or attempting to use advanced functionality, you probably want to use [browser_type.connect()](/api/class-browsertype.mdx#browser-type-connect).
:::

:::warning
Playwright maintains a curated list of arguments for launching the browser. If you launch the browser without Playwright and do not pass the exact same arguments, some of Playwright functionality may be broken upon connecting to the browser.
:::

**Usage**

**sync**

```py
browser = playwright.chromium.connect_over_cdp("http://localhost:9222")
default_context = browser.contexts0
page = default_context.pages0
```

**async**

```py
browser = await playwright.chromium.connect_over_cdp("http://localhost:9222")
default_context = browser.contexts0
page = default_context.pages0
```

**Arguments**
- `endpoint_url` str 
  
  A CDP websocket endpoint or http url to connect to. For example `http://localhost:9222/` or `ws://127.0.0.1:9222/devtools/browser/387adf4c-243f-4051-a181-46798f4a46f4`.
- `artifacts_dir` Union\[str, pathlib.Path\] *(optional)* 
  
  If specified, browser artifacts (such as traces and downloads) are saved into this directory.
- `headers` Dict\[str, str\] *(optional)* 
  
  Additional HTTP headers to be sent with connect request. Optional.
- `is_local` bool *(optional)* 
  
  Tells Playwright that it runs on the same host as the CDP server. It will enable certain optimizations that rely upon the file system being the same between Playwright and the Browser.
- `no_defaults` bool *(optional)* 
  
  When true, Playwright will not apply its default overrides to the existing default browser context. Specifically, [accept_downloads](/api/class-browser.mdx#browser-new-context-option-accept-downloads) is left at the browser's setting, focus emulation is not enabled, and media emulation options (such as [color_scheme](/api/class-browser.mdx#browser-new-context-option-color-scheme), [reduced_motion](/api/class-browser.mdx#browser-new-context-option-reduced-motion), [forced_colors](/api/class-browser.mdx#browser-new-context-option-forced-colors), and [contrast](/api/class-browser.mdx#browser-new-context-option-contrast)) are not applied. Useful when attaching to a user's daily-driver browser where these overrides would interfere with existing browser state. New contexts created via [browser.new_context()](/api/class-browser.mdx#browser-new-context) are not affected. Defaults to `false`.
- `slow_mo` float *(optional)* 
  
  Slows down Playwright operations by the specified amount of milliseconds. Useful so that you can see what is going on. Defaults to 0.
- `timeout` float *(optional)* 
  
  Maximum time in milliseconds to wait for the connection to be established. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds). Pass `0` to disable timeout.

**Returns**
- Browser

---

### launch {/* #browser-type-launch */}



Returns the browser instance.

**Usage**

You can use [ignore_default_args](/api/class-browsertype.mdx#browser-type-launch-option-ignore-default-args) to filter out `--mute-audio` from default arguments:

**sync**

```py
browser = playwright.chromium.launch( # or "firefox" or "webkit".
    ignore_default_args="--mute-audio"
)
```

**async**

```py
browser = await playwright.chromium.launch( # or "firefox" or "webkit".
    ignore_default_args="--mute-audio"
)
```

> **Chromium-only** Playwright can also be used to control the Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge browsers, but it works best with the version of Chromium it is bundled with. There is no guarantee it will work with any other version. Use [executable_path](/api/class-browsertype.mdx#browser-type-launch-option-executable-path) option with extreme caution.
>
> If Google Chrome (rather than Chromium) is preferred, a [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html) or [Dev Channel](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel) build is suggested.
>
> Stock browsers like Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge are suitable for tests that require proprietary media codecs for video playback. See [this article](https://www.howtogeek.com/202825/what%E2%80%99s-the-difference-between-chromium-and-chrome/) for other differences between Chromium and Chrome. [This article](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkgr/docs/chromium_browser_vs_google_chrome.md) describes some differences for Linux users.

**Arguments**
- `args` List\[str\] *(optional)*
  
  :::warning

### launch_persistent_context {/* #browser-type-launch-persistent-context */}



Returns the persistent browser context instance.

Launches browser that uses persistent storage located at [user_data_dir](/api/class-browsertype.mdx#browser-type-launch-persistent-context-option-user-data-dir) and returns the only context. Closing this context will automatically close the browser.

**Usage**

```python
browser_type.launch_persistent_context(user_data_dir)
browser_type.launch_persistent_context(user_data_dir, **kwargs)
```

**Arguments**
- `user_data_dir` Union\[str, pathlib.Path\]
  
  Path to a User Data Directory, which stores browser session data like cookies and local storage. Pass an empty string to create a temporary directory.
  
  More details for [Chromium](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/user_data_dir.md#introduction) and [Firefox](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/CommandLineOptions#User_profile). Chromium's user data directory is the **parent** directory of the "Profile Path" seen at `chrome://version`.
  
  Note that browsers do not allow launching multiple instances with the same User Data Directory.
  
  :::warning
  
  Chromium/Chrome: Due to recent Chrome policy changes, automating the default Chrome user profile is not supported. Pointing `userDataDir` to Chrome's main "User Data" directory (the profile used for your regular browsing) may result in pages not loading or the browser exiting. Create and use a separate directory (for example, an empty folder) as your automation profile instead. See https://developer.chrome.com/blog/remote-debugging-port for details.
  :::
  
- `accept_downloads` bool *(optional)*
  
  Whether to automatically download all the attachments. Defaults to `true` where all the downloads are accepted.

- `artifacts_dir` Union\[str, pathlib.Path\] *(optional)*
  
  If specified, artifacts (traces, videos, downloads, HAR files, etc.) are saved into this directory. The directory is not cleaned up when the browser closes. If not specified, a temporary directory is used and cleaned up when the browser closes.
- `base_url` str *(optional)*
  
  When using [page.goto()](/api/class-page.mdx#page-goto), [page.route()](/api/class-page.mdx#page-route), [page.wait_for_url()](/api/class-page.mdx#page-wait-for-url), [page.expect_request()](/api/class-page.mdx#page-wait-for-request), or [page.expect_response()](/api/class-page.mdx#page-wait-for-response) it takes the base URL in consideration by using the [`URL()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/URL) constructor for building the corresponding URL. Unset by default. Examples:
  * baseURL: `http://localhost:3000` and navigating to `/bar.html` results in `http://localhost:3000/bar.html`
  * baseURL: `http://localhost:3000/foo/` and navigating to `./bar.html` results in `http://localhost:3000/foo/bar.html`
  * baseURL: `http://localhost:3000/foo` (without trailing slash) and navigating to `./bar.html` results in `http://localhost:3000/bar.html`

  Toggles bypassing page's Content-Security-Policy. Defaults to `false`.
- `channel` str *(optional)*
  
  Browser distribution channel.
  
  Use "chromium" to [opt in to new headless mode](../browsers.mdx#chromium-new-headless-mode).
  
  Use "chrome", "chrome-beta", "chrome-dev", "chrome-canary", "msedge", "msedge-beta", "msedge-dev", or "msedge-canary" to use branded [Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge](../browsers.mdx#google-chrome--microsoft-edge).
- `chromium_sandbox` bool *(optional)*
  
  Enable Chromium sandboxing. Defaults to `false`.
- `client_certificates` List\[Dict\] *(optional)* 
  - `origin` str
    
    Exact origin that the certificate is valid for. Origin includes `https` protocol, a hostname and optionally a port.
  - `certPath` Union\[str, pathlib.Path\] *(optional)*
    
    Path to the file with the certificate in PEM format.
  - `cert` bytes *(optional)*

  TLS Client Authentication allows the server to request a client certificate and verify it.
  
  **Details**
  
  An array of client certificates to be used. Each certificate object must have either both `certPath` and `keyPath`, a single `pfxPath`, or their corresponding direct value equivalents (`cert` and `key`, or `pfx`). Optionally, `passphrase` property should be provided if the certificate is encrypted. The `origin` property should be provided with an exact match to the request origin that the certificate is valid for.
  
  Client certificate authentication is only active when at least one client certificate is provided. If you want to reject all client certificates sent by the server, you need to provide a client certificate with an `origin` that does not match any of the domains you plan to visit.
  
  :::note
  
  When using WebKit on macOS, accessing `localhost` will not pick up client certificates. You can make it work by replacing `localhost` with `local.playwright`.

    page height in pixels.
  
  Emulates consistent window screen size available inside web page via `window.screen`. Is only used when the [viewport](/api/class-browsertype.mdx#browser-type-launch-persistent-context-option-viewport) is set.
- `service_workers` "allow" | "block" *(optional)*
  
  Whether to allow sites to register Service workers. Defaults to `'allow'`.
  * `'allow'`: [Service Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) can be registered.
  * `'block'`: Playwright will block all registration of Service Workers.
- `slow_mo` float *(optional)*
  
  Slows down Playwright operations by the specified amount of milliseconds. Useful so that you can see what is going on.
- `strict_selectors` bool *(optional)*
  
  If set to true, enables strict selectors mode for this context. In the strict selectors mode all operations on selectors that imply single target DOM element will throw when more than one element matches the selector. This option does not affect any Locator APIs (Locators are always strict). Defaults to `false`. See Locator to learn more about the strict mode.
- `timeout` float *(optional)*
  
  Maximum time in milliseconds to wait for the browser instance to start. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds). Pass `0` to disable timeout.
- `timezone_id` str *(optional)*
  
  Changes the timezone of the context. See [ICU's metaZones.txt](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/icu/source/data/misc/metaZones.txt?rcl=faee8bc70570192d82d2978a71e2a615788597d1) for a list of supported timezone IDs. Defaults to the system timezone.
- `traces_dir` Union\[str, pathlib.Path\] *(optional)*
  
  If specified, traces are saved into this directory.
- `user_agent` str *(optional)*
  
  Specific user agent to use in this context.
- `viewport` NoneType | Dict *(optional)*
  - `width` int
    
    page width in pixels.
  - `height` int
    
    page height in pixels.
  
  Sets a consistent viewport for each page. Defaults to an 1280x720 viewport. `no_viewport` disables the fixed viewport. Learn more about [viewport emulation](../emulation.mdx#viewport).
