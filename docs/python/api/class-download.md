# Download

> **Source:** [playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-download](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-download)

---

Download objects are dispatched by page via the [page.on("download")](/api/class-page.mdx#page-event-download) event.

All the downloaded files belonging to the browser context are deleted when the browser context is closed.

Download event is emitted once the download starts. Download path becomes available once download completes.

**sync**

```py
# Start waiting for the download
with page.expect_download() as download_info:
    # Perform the action that initiates download
    page.get_by_text("Download file").click()
download = download_info.value

# Wait for the download process to complete and save the downloaded file somewhere
download.save_as("/path/to/save/at/" + download.suggested_filename)
```

**async**

```py
# Start waiting for the download
async with page.expect_download() as download_info:
    # Perform the action that initiates download
    await page.get_by_text("Download file").click()
download = await download_info.value

# Wait for the download process to complete and save the downloaded file somewhere
await download.save_as("/path/to/save/at/" + download.suggested_filename)
```

## Methods

### cancel {/* #download-cancel */}



Cancels a download. Will not fail if the download is already finished or canceled. Upon successful cancellations, `download.failure()` would resolve to `'canceled'`.

**Usage**

```python
download.cancel()
```

**Returns**
- NoneType

---

### delete {/* #download-delete */}



Deletes the downloaded file. Will wait for the download to finish if necessary.

**Usage**

```python
download.delete()
```

**Returns**
- NoneType

---

### failure {/* #download-failure */}



Returns download error if any. Will wait for the download to finish if necessary.

**Usage**

```python
download.failure()
```

**Returns**
- NoneType | str

---

### path {/* #download-path */}



Returns path to the downloaded file for a successful download, or throws for a failed/canceled download. The method will wait for the download to finish if necessary. The method throws when connected remotely.

Note that the download's file name is a random GUID, use [download.suggested_filename](/api/class-download.mdx#download-suggested-filename) to get suggested file name.

**Usage**

```python
download.path()
```

**Returns**
- pathlib.Path

---

### save_as {/* #download-save-as */}



Copy the download to a user-specified path. It is safe to call this method while the download is still in progress. Will wait for the download to finish if necessary.

**Usage**

**sync**

```py
download.save_as("/path/to/save/at/" + download.suggested_filename)
```

**async**

```py
await download.save_as("/path/to/save/at/" + download.suggested_filename)
```

**Arguments**
- `path` Union\[str, pathlib.Path\]
  
  Path where the download should be copied.

**Returns**
- NoneType

---

## Properties

### page {/* #download-page */}



Get the page that the download belongs to.

**Usage**

```python
download.page
```

**Returns**
- Page

---

### suggested_filename {/* #download-suggested-filename */}



Returns suggested filename for this download. It is typically computed by the browser from the [`Content-Disposition`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition) response header or the `download` attribute. See the spec on [whatwg](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#downloading-resources). Different browsers can use different logic for computing it.

**Usage**

```python
download.suggested_filename
```

**Returns**
- str

---

### url {/* #download-url */}



Returns downloaded url.

**Usage**

```python
download.url
```

**Returns**
- str
